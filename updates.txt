hello guys, so there are updates to the website

first of all here is the updated structure of the events table
and the database.

first we will not have a table for all the participants as that poses several problems
	problem 1: Events can be big, such having a table with ALL the participants from past, present
	and future events may not be efficient as it could reach 10,000+ 

	Solution: Suppose there is a CSV file, of the participants, need to find a way so that when an event has started
	only the data of the participants CSV file is loaded into the events and find a way to make it secure and work with mysql

Design a CSV file format and the code to read and store data and to load.
	in this CSV file there would be the participants ID and Name, email and verification token and as we need the event ID aswell

check dbadmin.dcism.org for the database, u guys know the password
